# TODO

* Write an intentionally panicking program and make sure that running it does not cause `er` to panic.
* Try sending massive amounts of data down stdout or something like that to try an get `er` to panic.
* If we found any ways for a command to make `er` panic, then start attempting to save the history on panic.
