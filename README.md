# er

`er` stands for Executable Runner. This is a very simple shell, (read: without a terminal emulator), that only runs execuatbles and does not offer scripting beyond a few ways to chain commands together.

#### Licensing

This code is available under the MIT License.

The initial version of this project was based on the code from Josh McGuigan's [build-your-own-shell article](https://www.joshmcguigan.com/blog/build-your-own-shell-rust/), specifically [from this commit](https://github.com/JoshMcguigan/bubble-shell/blob/a6b81d837e4f5e68cf0b72a4d55e95fb08a47640/src/main.rs). That code is also available under MIT.

#### What's in this "old" folder?

That folder contains a previous project with the same name, but which was also trying to supply a terminal emulator as well.

That code is available, again, under the MIT License.
